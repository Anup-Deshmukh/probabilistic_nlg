the economy has been stagnant for a while now . weve been in a recessive state for several months already . what worries me the most is the trade deficit . i think the government should do more to encourage exports .,"increasing exports would weaken the currency . i think the main point is economic growth . we need more jobs . factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . the result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . if more people are working , it will give the economy a boost ."

i guessed it .,"well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the worlds tourist attractions as well ."
"i know youre right . school is more important than tv . can i watch one more show , then go to bed .","no , now its bedtime ."
